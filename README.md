# Blue Lab Chair Detection using YOLOv5

## Overview
This project uses **YOLOv5** to detect blue lab chairs in images or video streams. The notebook includes steps for setting up the model, loading input images, running inference, and displaying detected objects.

## Features
- Loads a **YOLOv5** model for object detection
- Detects and classifies blue lab chairs
- Displays bounding boxes around detected objects
- Supports image input for testing

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python yolov5
```

## Usage
1. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell in order.
2. **Load an Image**: The notebook processes an image containing lab chairs.
3. **Run Detection**: The YOLOv5 model detects and labels objects in the image.
4. **View Results**: The output image is displayed with bounding boxes.

## File Structure
- `Blue_Lab_Chair_Detection_with_yolov5.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for object detection
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project

## Notes
- Make sure your images are stored in the correct path before running the detection.
- Adjust model parameters if necessary for better accuracy.
